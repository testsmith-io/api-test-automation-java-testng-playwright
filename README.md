[![API Test Automation with Java, TestNG, and Playwright - Run Tests](https://github.com/testsmith-io/api-test-automation-java-testng-playwright/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/testsmith-io/api-test-automation-java-testng-playwright/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

This repository contains example scripts for API test automation using:
- **Java**
- **Playwright** for API interaction
- **TestNG** for test execution

## Features
- Examples of GET, POST, and Protected API requests.
- Clear demonstration of test automation practices with assertions and chaining requests.
- Fully automated CI pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Test API
All examples in this repository are designed to work with the **Practice Software Testing API**, a publicly available API for learning and practicing software testing. You can explore the API documentation and endpoints here:
